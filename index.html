The methane is created when plants, and animals in the lake sink to the bottom and react with the bacteria in the water. the bacteria begins to break down the organic matter, decomposing them, slowly releasing the gas. Usually the gas floats its way to the top of the lake where it is released in the air, but when the lake freezes over, methane struggles a little more to find it’s freedom.
